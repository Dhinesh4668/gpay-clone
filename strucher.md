# Flutter Professional Business Logic Project Structure

To structure a professional business logic project in Flutter, it is important to separate concerns by organizing your code into various layers, like **presentation**, **business logic**, **data**, and **domain**. Here's a common structure used in enterprise-level projects, which promotes maintainability, scalability, and testability:

## Suggested Flutter Project Structure

### 1. **lib/**
This is the main directory where your source code resides.

#### 1. **Core:**
This folder holds core utilities that are shared across the app, like constants, themes, and global configuration.

- `core/`
    - `constants/`: Contains app-wide constants (e.g., app colors, fonts, sizes).
    - `utils/`: Helper classes and utilities.
    - `error/`: Error handling classes, custom exceptions, etc.
    - `theme/`: App theme, custom text styles, etc.
    - `routes/`: Route handling and navigation.

#### 2. **Presentation Layer:**
This is the UI layer where widgets and screens reside.

- `presentation/`
    - `screens/`: Holds individual screen widgets (e.g., login, dashboard).
    - `widgets/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, custom cards).
    - `view_models/`: For state management (e.g., using `Provider`, `Bloc`, `Riverpod`).
    - `animations/`: Custom animations used across the app.
    - `resources/`: Assets like images, fonts, localization files, etc.

#### 3. **Domain Layer:**
The domain layer holds business logic, entities, and use cases. It’s independent of external dependencies.

- `domain/`
    - `entities/`: Defines plain Dart models for the app's core business logic.
    - `repositories/`: Interfaces that define contracts for data access and manipulation.
    - `use_cases/`: Encapsulates a specific business logic use case (e.g., `GetUserData`, `UpdateProfile`).

#### 4. **Data Layer:**
This is where the actual data handling happens, interacting with APIs, databases, or any external services.

- `data/`
    - `models/`: Data models, typically implementing `toJson()` and `fromJson()` for serialization.
    - `data_sources/`: Abstract classes or interfaces that represent data sources (e.g., local DB, remote APIs).
        - `remote/`: Contains API clients and HTTP services.
        - `local/`: Handles local persistence, such as SQLite or shared preferences.
    - `repositories/`: Implements domain layer repositories with actual data manipulation logic.

#### 5. **Dependency Injection (Optional but recommended):**
Dependency injection ensures that your components are loosely coupled and can be easily tested.

- `di/`
    - `service_locator.dart`: Sets up the service locator (e.g., using `GetIt` for dependency injection).

#### 6. **Configuration Layer:**
This layer holds environment configurations and API setup.

- `config/`
    - `environment/`: Handles app environment setup (e.g., dev, staging, production).
    - `api/`: API endpoints, headers, base URL configurations.

### Example Project Directory Tree:

```bash
lib/
│
├── core/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── error/
│   ├── theme/
│   └── routes/
│
├── presentation/
│   ├── screens/
│   ├── widgets/
│   ├── view_models/
│   ├── animations/
│   └── resources/
│
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── use_cases/
│
├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── data_sources/
│   │   ├── remote/
│   │   └── local/
│   └── repositories/
│
├── di/
│   └── service_locator.dart
│
├── config/
│   ├── environment/
│   └── api/
│
└── main.dart
```

### Key Principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide the code into different layers and directories to keep the app modular.
- **Scalability**: This structure is scalable, making it easier to add new features without impacting other modules.
- **Testability**: By decoupling data and logic from UI, it becomes easier to write unit tests for the business logic.
- **State Management**: You can choose state management libraries like `Provider`, `Bloc`, or `Riverpod` depending on your preference.

This project structure should help you in building a clean, maintainable, and scalable business logic-focused Flutter application.
